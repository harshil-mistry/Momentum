# Momentum 🚀

### Stop the chaos. Find your flow.

Momentum is a super simple, clean, and visual way to manage your projects. It's designed to get out of your way so you can focus on what's important: building cool stuff and getting things done.

Think of it as the perfect middle-ground between a messy notepad file and an over-engineered corporate tool you need a 3-day training course to use.

### What's Inside? (The Features)

* ✨ **Clean Dashboard:** A bird's-eye view of all your projects. No clutter, just what you need.

* 📊 **Progress Meters:** A satisfying little progress bar on each project card to see how close you are to glory.

* 🖐️ **Drag-and-Drop Kanban:** The star of the show! Visually track your tasks from `To-Do` ➡️ `In-Progress` ➡️ `Completed`.

* 📝 **Notes:** A dedicated spot for each project to jot down ideas, client feedback, or code snippets.

* 🌗 **Light/Dark Mode:** For those late-night coding sessions.

* 🔐 **User Accounts:** Keep your projects private and secure.

### The Secret Sauce (Tech Stack)
